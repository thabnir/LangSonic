# Language Detection Model
## Team 5 (Basel, Henry, Abrar)

### Brief Description:
Welcome to our Language Detection Model! This project aims to automatically identify the language of a given text or voice note using signal processing, making it a versatile tool for applications such as content filtering, language-specific analysis, and more.

#### Note that our choice of datasets and algorithms are subject to change and will be finalized as we progress further into our project. For now, we will be providing the information we temporarily decided on.
